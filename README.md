- **The global Origami Market size was valued at USD 0.25 Billion in 2024 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5%. Artists and designers are increasingly blending the ancient Japanese art form with innovative technology, creating intricate, three-dimensional paper sculptures that capture the imagination of a diverse audience.**
- **Ori(go) is the new Pokemon GO Killer** and is described as a social media platform/ digital repository designed to reduce the barrier of entry for learning origami and paper folding. By integrating characters, challenges, rewards, and progress tracking, the app incentivizes users to fold, collect, and trade 3d digital crypto based on a convolutional neural network and a system of gami (origami value based on Black Sholes modeling).
